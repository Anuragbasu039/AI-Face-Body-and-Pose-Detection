# AI Face, Body, and Pose Detection with Python

Welcome to the **AI Face, Body, and Pose Detection** project — a Python-based application that uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect facial features, full-body posture, and pose landmarks. Built with **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, this project runs in a **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development and demonstration.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use deep learning models for:

- **Face Mesh Detection** — Real-time tracking of facial landmarks.
- **Pose Estimation** — Full-body skeleton tracking with 33 body keypoints.
- **Holistic Detection** — Combined face, hand, and pose tracking.

All detections are applied to live webcam input, making it ideal for real-time applications.
